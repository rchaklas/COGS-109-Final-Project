# NFL Player Position Prediction Using Multi-Class K-Nearest Neighbors
This repo contains code for a final project for COGS109: Modeling and Data Analysis, describing the results of using a K-Nearest Neighbors model to classify the position of NFL players using their height and weight information provided by the NFL on their website (http://www.nfl.com).

The modelling code is in the `COGS109_Data_Wrangling_and_Modelling.ipynb` notebook and the final report paper can be accessed [here](https://rchaklas.github.io/COGS-109-Final-Project/COGS109Final_Paper.pdf).
